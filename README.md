# LitePIG :a Lite Parameter Inference system for the Gravitational Waves in the millihertz band
LitePIG is software developed by Renjie Wang and Bin Hu. 
It is open source and publicly available.
The softwavre package include the follwing features: the GW waveform emitted from the massive black hole binaries, the stationary instrumental gaussian noise, the higher-order harmonic modes, the full response function from the time delay interfermetry(TDI) and the gaussian likelihood function with the dynamic nested parameter sampler.
These examples explore how to generate the GW waveform, how we generate LISA instrumental noise, and how to esitmate the GW parameter.
